                <h1>Project vision</h1>
                <p>sew is a Tailor discovery service that primarily allows users to search for tailors with the press of the button With current tailor applications, the data visualization and sharing of reviews are either non-existent, very limited, or extremely outdated. Sew aims to fix that by bridging the gap between potential users themselves</p>

                <h1>kickstart</h1>
                <p>Starting off, I asked myself a few initial questions. Who is our primary user? What kind of goals do they have? Why would someone want to use this application? Just how large of a scope do I want this project to be? After interviewing four participants to establish archetypes later on, it became evident that the goals they wanted to accomplish all fell within the same categories; finding out more about their clothing habits & identifying more of the clothes they like.</p>

                <h1>Competetive Analysis</h1>
                <p>
                    In order to construct a concise and solid foundation for Sew, I had to venture out and see what the prominent tailor applications were already doing and what user goals they were not reaching. I evaluated several features deemed vital from user surveys and identified which ones Sew could capitalize on to have a leg up over other applications.
                    <br>

                    
                    
                    I found that none of the main competitors offered user profiles for users.
                    <br>
                    darzi on call offers a lot of variety but ux and user flow is not upto the mark.</p>

                <p>Creating easy-to-understand data visuals for users was a goal that helped drive this project as far as it did. I solved this issue by using simple navigation to help the user understand on a more familiar level.

                <p>In competitive analysis i found out that no competetion allows users to read write reviews or even show who will be sewing users clothes i thought that's a huge hole between user and the tailor so here i am to fill this gap and allows users to read write reviews which helps a lot to users to make their decisions easy

                    Utilizing colors consisting of and calm colors felt like the perfect fit for Sew's branding. The yellow helps evoke a happy feeling out of users , and paired with the black it creates a nice balance between calm and energetic. The main typeface of choice for the app is Karla. I felt this typeface best fit the app do to it's extreme versatility through uppercase and lowercase styling.

                    Being a lover of formal dresses myself, working on Sew was incredibly rewarding. I got to experiment with some of the new Adobe XD features and narrow down my design process. Although I was not able to fully flesh out other features and designs I wanted to within Sew due to time constraints, it's not to say I won't try to incorporate them in future projects down the line.
